SUBJECT: MACHINE LEARNING 


In the first question we will implement the pandas as pd and seaborn as sns and after that we should have that train.csv file in the document in order to get the output after inorder to get the head file document we will use the dataf.head() and inorder to find out the corelation between the survived and sex columns we will use the processing of label encoders and we will get the output after that if we need to get in the matrix stage we will use matrix relations to get in thje form of matrix atlast finding the first corelation in that we use background colour as green and we will get the output as green matrix form and similiarly in the second corelation to find in the form of axis we use plot 
In the naive bias we also used the append to divide the relations and also we find the drop missing values from the train  data set and atlast using classifier gaussian and using the scikit-learn library and reported the accuracy as output 0.7552447552447552. This is the first question 



Second question:In this question using the glass dataset we will the glass head values and after that we find the corelations of color and axis as we seen in the first question but here we use another dataset named glass and after that using the train_test_split we have cretaed the accuracy score and testing part we get the accuracy of final score 
and also atlast using the source vector classifier also we get the accuracy score as shown in the word document 

Thanks
